This mod is an overhaul to the injury and healing system in the game. It adds buildings to heal beavers quicker and goods to aid in healing.

### Features:
- Reworked Herbalist to quickly heal beavers using science.
- Added Medbay for the Iron Teeth that functions similar to the Herbalist.
- Added poultices for Folktails to heal bee stings.
- Added salves for Iron Teeth to continue working while injured, with a penalty.
